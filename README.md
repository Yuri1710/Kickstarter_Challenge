>#Kickstarter_Challenge

**Overview of project.**
With all the skills and knowledge obtained from this first module we have the tools to analyze and provide a better data visualization with graphics, such as formulas, pivot tables,formating and more. Our main object is to take a deep dive to help Louise with her project with the different kinds of kickstarters compaigns she has and get to the goal.

**Analysis and Challenges.**
Among the main parameters we measured was the "theater" sector, we could validate that more than the 50% of the compaign in the US was successful with our bar graphic:

Among the topics we saw was "percentages", in case Louise, asked us for this data to better understand we can share it, so it can be easier to explain her and provide her suggestions to work on our 38.27% of failed and rise our successful outcome.

On the other hand, we can see that the month of May is when it has been achieved to have more success throughout the year, as well as failed outcomes, this can be derived to the volume we handle (it can be a high season).

Thea goals we have for our kickstarter commpaign are very varied, our greatest success is from 1000 to 4999, which is equivalent to 73% of the total projects, and with respect to the failed outcomes they are in the same parameter from 1000 to 4999, representing 27.34% of our total.

Finally, we saw that our mean goal of the successful compaigns is **$5,049**, and our median goal is **$3,000**, our standard successful deviation of pledged is for **$5,602**. 

None of these exercises were easy since I had never used them except vlookup, xlookup, sum and pivot tables, all were a great challenge and I am sure that with practice I will make them simple in my day to day, it took me hours to solve them, with the support of Canvas, internet sources, and videos on youtube but the result was satisfactory, however, I would have liked to learn more formulas.

**Results**: 
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? *Theaters outcomes in May are more successful,on the other hand we have more failed outcomes in October, and finally we hace more cancel outcomes on January, the rest of the year we have almost the same parameter of canceled outcomes.*

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? *Our highest percentage of outcomes are less than 1000 and outcomes with the highest failures are from 1000 to 4999 corresponding to 27.34%*.

What are some limitations of this dataset? *I haven't detected one yet.*

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? *Map graphs, it would be really awesome to be able to see by country parameters like: who has the greatest success in goal, visually it would be very attractive.*
